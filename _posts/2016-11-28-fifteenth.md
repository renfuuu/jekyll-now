<h3> What did you do this past week? </h3>
This past week I worked with my group to wrap up our semester long project, and present the work we did along side them.
<h3> What's in your way? </h3>
This was the busiest week of I daresay my entire semester, I had an Android application to complete, Unity Environment to create for my 3D art class, and this project plus the test.
<h3> What will you do next week? </h3>
I will be participating in Digital Demo day for my 3D art class, demoing my Android app for my professor and classmates, going to Atlanta for an Interview, and studying for an exam.
<h2> Thanksgiving, Presentation and Test </h2>
You may have noticed that there was no week 14. That is because, Professor Downing said there wasn't a blog entry due. This is because week 14 was only one day because of the Thanksgiving holiday.  The daily quizzes are no more at this point. 
All that was left was for each group to present their project and critique the project before them. I think ours went really well except I think my body was shaking. It was odd, I wasn't particularly nervous (especially in front of my fellow classmates), but it still happened. 
After our presentation on Wednesday was the Test. The test was very straightforward, just like the previous exam. I think and hope I did really well on this one. I finished early. 
<h4> Tip of the Week </h4>
Ask how to study for the test on Piazza. The main reason I think I did so well on the exam, was because Professor Downing narrowed down the topics that would be on the test when someone asked on Piazza. We learned a lot of material after the first exam. Beforehand, Professor Downing put up the list of topics we covered for the second portion of the class. I tried studying it all, but it was overwhelming. But when I saw that post, I was able to focus on key subjects and do well. 
Another tip: do the extra credit!
