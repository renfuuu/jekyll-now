<h3> What did you do this past week?</h3>
This week I completed the collatz program and learned more about Python.
<h3> What's in your way? </h3>
Sphere was in my way. 
<h3> What will you do next week? </h3>
Next week, I'll start the second project.
<h2> Collatz and Python </h2>
The 3n + 1 problem is a fairly simple one to solve. However, optimizing my code to be fast enough for Sphere's judges was not as simple. Also sphere got in my way because of its incorrect inputs. There's a concept of estimating how long it'll take you to complete a project. For this one I guessed 20 hours. I was wrong. This took me roughly 6 to 8 hours to complete. 

I'm glad Professor Downing explained components of Python because now with this knowledge I can avoid common bugs more often. The quizzes this week made sure I was doing the readings for class as well as strengthen my understanding of pythons mutable and immutable types.
<h4> Tip of the Week </h4>
PARTICIPATE ON PIAZZA. Participation on piazza is very important. It not only helps you solve your problems, but also helps the community who may encounter the same problems. Remember to read all the posts and not just the ones that seem relevant to you. This helps prevent duplicated questions. If you decide not to participate on piazza you just might be called out by Professor Downing during class.
