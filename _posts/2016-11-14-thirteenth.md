<h3> What did you do this past week? </h3>
I spent this past week working on Phase 3 with my group. We failed to entirely complete Phase 2. We put in more hours than last time in order to finish both phases.
<h3> What's in your way? </h3>
Nothing was particular in my way for this class this week.
<h3> What will you do next week? </h3>
Next week, I will plan the presentation and D3 visualization with my group. Then take a break for the Thanksgiving holiday. 
<h2> Design Patterns and Spiceworks </h2>
The class continued to focus on design patterns. I gained a better understanding of keywords such as final, abstract, and static. The design patterns we looked at were Singleton pattern, dynamic binding, and reflection. I liked that we learned about singleton patterns. I've heard of them before, but never implemented them like we did in class. I didn't know how useful the Class class was until this lecture. I used to think that it was just a parent class for Java's internal structure. This course was a lot of Python in the beginning, so it was nice to see a Python example of all the refactoring we did in Java.
We had our last company talk on Wednesday. Spiceworks came to tell us more about industry. I felt we didn't learn many new things because the previous companies iterated the same information. However, one could say that this is a good thing because that knowledge is commonplace amongst several companies. The one interesting thing they talked about was when they brought up stock options. 
<h4> Tip of the Week </h4>
The tip for this week is give back. This tip is one the tips I received from Spiceworks. We, as programmers, are constantly on stack overflow, Google, Github, and etc. We use these resources to solve problems, improve our code, etc. To keep the community going strong, I recommend giving back to those sources. Help someone else. Not only is it a nice thing to do, it also looks great on your resume. Plus it's experience. Can never go wrong with gaining more of that. This doesn't only apply to computer science. You can give back to many different communities you are a part of in several different ways.
