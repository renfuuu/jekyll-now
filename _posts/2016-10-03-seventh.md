<h3> What did you do this past week? </h3>
I took the exam for this class.
<h3> What's in your way? </h3>
Nothing was in my way.
<h3> What will you do next week? </h3>
I will begin working on this newly assigned project with my group.
<h2> Exam </h2>
I believe I mentioned that Professor Downing did not give much review on the exam, but I was wrong. I realized during the exam that he had been teaching us everything we needed to know for the test. The test was primarily writing python classes and functions. 

The test was fair. I wish there were some multiple choice, but I think I did well on the exam. I didn't really use the one sheet of notes that Professor Downing allows, but now that I know how he creates his exams I should have more useful information to put on it. 

I felt we were a bit behind on the topics as the schedule would constantly change and push topics till later. The biggest evidence of this was the review post on Piazza vs the topics we covered in class. Most of it was covered of course, but I felt the class day before the exam was rushed to fit in the missing pieces. One of the pieces, ** in parameter list was not touched, but we weren't tested on that.

<h4> Tip of the Week </h4>
Professor Downing graciously doesn't make a project due 2 weeks before the next exam so make sure you use all of those two weeks to study. If you're like me, you'll need it.
